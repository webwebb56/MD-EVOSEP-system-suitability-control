# INSTRUMENTS

# Add one [[instruments]] section for each instrument you want to monitor.
# Remove or comment out the examples below and add your own.

# Example: Thermo instrument
# [[instruments]]
# id = "EXPLORIS01"                              # A unique name for this instrument
# vendor = "thermo"                              # thermo, bruker, sciex, waters, agilent
# watch_path = "D:\\Data"                        # Where raw files are saved
# file_pattern = "*.raw"                         # File extension to watch
# template = "C:\\ProgramData\\MassDynamics\\QC\\templates\\my_template.sky"

# Example: Bruker timsTOF

# id = "TIMSTOF01"
# vendor = "bruker"
# watch_path = "D:\\Data\\timsTOF"
# file_pattern = "*.d"
# template = "C:\\ProgramData\\MassDynamics\\QC\\templates\\tims_template.sky"
